# [challengeName](link-to-challenge)

<!--
  describe the function's behavior in your own words.
  explain why someone might want to use this function
-->

## Syntax

> functionName(`type`, `type`, ...) -> `type`

### Parameters

**paramName**: `paramType`

<!--
  describe the parameter
-->

### Return Value: `type`

<!--
  describe the return value
-->

## Test Cases

<!--
  copy in the test cases from the original challenge

  if you write your own test cases in a sandbox file, include those too
-->

## Use Cases

<!--
  write a minimum of 2 use cases to show this functions behavior.

  try to find interesting _edge cases_, it's good for you ;)
  an edge case is when a function behaves different than you'd expect.
  This will help you and others better understand the function.
